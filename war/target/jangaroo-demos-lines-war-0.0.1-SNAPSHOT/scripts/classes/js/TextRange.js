   * Compares an end point of a TextRange object with an end point of another range.
   * <p> A text range has two end points. One end point is located at the beginning of the text range, and the other is
   * located at the end of the text range. An end point also can be characterized as the position between two characters
   * in an HTML document.
   * <p>As of Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0, an end point is relative to text only, not HTML tags.
   * <p>There are four possible end points in the following HTML:

   * &lt;BODY>&lt;P>&lt;B>abc

   * The possible end points are:
   * <ul>
   * <li>Before the letter a.

   * <li>Between the letters b and c.

   * Searches for text in the document and positions the start and end points of the range to encompass the search
   * string.
   * <p>A range has two distinct states: degenerate and nondegenerate.
   * <p>A degenerate range is like a text editor caret (insertion point) ï¿½it does not actually select any characters.
   * Instead, it specifies a point between two characters. The end points of a degenerate range are adjacent.
   * <p>A nondegenerate range is like a text editor selection, in that it selects a certain amount of text. The end
   * points of a nondegenerate range are not adjacent.
   * <p>The value passed for the iSearchScope parameter controls the part of the document, relative to the range, that
   * is searched. The behavior of the findText method depends on whether the state is degenerate or nondegenerate:
   * <ul>
   * <li>If the range is degenerate, passing a large positive number causes the text to the right of the range to be
   *   searched. Passing a large negative number causes the text to the left of the range to be searched.
   * <li>If the range is nondegenerate, passing a large positive number causes the text to the right of the start of
   *   the range to be searched. Passing a large negative number causes the text to the left of the end of the range
   *   to be searched. Passing 0 causes only the text selected by the range to be searched.

   * @param text specifies the text to find.
