/**
 * The URLLoader class downloads data from a URL as text, binary data, or URL-encoded variables.
 * It is useful for downloading text files, XML, or other information to be used in a dynamic, data-driven application.
 * <p>A URLLoader object downloads all of the data from a URL before making it available to ActionScript. It sends out
 * notifications about the progress of the download, which you can monitor through the bytesLoaded and bytesTotal
 * properties, as well as through dispatched events.
 * <p>The value you pass for the url parameter must, by default, be in exactly the same domain. For example, a SWF file
 * at www.adobe.com can load data only from sources that are also at www.adobe.com. To load data from a different
 * domain, place a cross-domain policy file on the server hosting the SWF file.

   *  URLRequest.data parameter from UTF8 to MBCS. This error is applicable if the URLRequest object passed to load()
   *  is set to perform a GET operation and if System.useCodePage is set to true. 2) Flash Player cannot allocate
